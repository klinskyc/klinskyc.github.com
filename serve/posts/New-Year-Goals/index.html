  </h1>

  <section class="byline">
    January  4, 2014
  </section>

  <p>It just became 2014 and I figured it would be a good time as any to lay out my goals for this year.
Since I feel more accountable if I fail my goals publicly, I decided to post them here. Some of the main goals
have sub-goals that I need to meet if I want to fulfill the main goal.</p>

<h3>1. Get Into a Great College</h3>

<ul>
<li><h5>Get Straight A&rsquo;s (A Range)</h5>

<p>This is just one of the things that I need to get done if I want to have a competitive application. I was only
one grade off last trimester so this is definitely in the realm of possibility.</p></li>
<li><h5>Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)</h5>

<p>As much as I hate taking them, I need to have great standardized test scores. I&rsquo;m not too off on practice
tests so this is also within my reach.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>2. Get Really Fit</h3>

<ul>
<li><h5>Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m 8-8 right now and we have a mix of both easy and difficult matches to end out the season. If I perform well
at tournaments I should be able to accomplish this.</p></li>
<li><h5>Be Able to do 15 Pullups</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m not starting from 0 with this but I need to get my numbers up from 3-4 to 15. I think this will best be
accomplished by doing <a href="http://manlypat.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/armstrong-pull-up-program/">this</a>.</p></li>
<li><h5>Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k</h5>

<p>I really hate running, I find it incredibly boring and I can&rsquo;t ever stick to a running program (unlike a lifting program).
However, I would like to be good at running and this is accomplished by running. On a good day, I can run a 5k but
that&rsquo;s about it. I plan on using C25K and B210K.</p></li>
<li><h5>Increase lifting numbers</h5>

<p>Unlike running, I enjoy lifting and do it (when it&rsquo;s not wrestling season) 3 or 4 times a week. I would love to
increase all my lift numbers by a significant amount. Namely, I&rsquo;d like to hit a 1xBW Bench, a 1.5XBW Squat, and a
1.75BW DLift. I may run into a problem of this being mutually exclusive with running.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built</h3>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve built two SAAS&rsquo;s (mostly to really learn rails / you can see them on my projects page). Unfortunately,
I&rsquo;ve been unable to convert free customers to paying customers. I think the real reason for this is that my projects
don&rsquo;t solve painful enough problems. I&rsquo;m going to try and create a product that really uses lean startup principles.
 1. Find a problem via interviewing different professions.
 2. Build and constantly iterate a product that solves the aforementioned problem</p>

<h3>4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books</h3>

<p>As previously written about on this blog, I have a reading list that I&rsquo;m constantly updating. I want (start and) Finish
the remaining books left on the list. Last year, I read 17 books off my list, this year I hope to reach 20.</p>

<p> In the coming year, I really only have 1 thing that I&rsquo;m going to stick to religiously, the idea of no zero-days.
 I have a problem where I&rsquo;ll be incredibly productive for a few days and then do nothing for another few days. My
 overall goal is to always spend sometime every day getting closer to accomplishing these goals.</p>
