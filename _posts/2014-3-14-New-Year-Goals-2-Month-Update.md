It's two months to the day that I posted my initial goals. 
Since then, I've updated some of my goals, failed a few and, I'm on track to accomplish more.

### 1. Get Into a Great College
 * ##### Get Straight A's (A Range) 
 Second trimester grades are in. My grades increased as a whole but I still failed to get everything into the A range
 because one grade dipped.
  * ##### Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)
Got my scores back from the first time and I did well but math and writing were lower than normal so I'm going to
be retaking them on March 8th. This is the last time. 

### 2. Get Really Fit
 * ##### Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record
 Failed this one. I ended up going 13-16. I did place at both Ivies and States. I should have finished 3rd at Ivies but I blew
 a match I had in the bag.
 * ##### Be Able to do 15 Pullups
 No real progress, I need to do this on offdays. 
 * ##### Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k
 I've been doing some stationary cycling but no jogging. I've been focusing more on lifting.
 * ##### Increase lifting numbers
Lift numbers are getting back to what they were pre-wrestling season. I'm eating a lot and breaking plateaus.
My form on deadlift suffers when I get above 200 so I need deload and focus on form. 

### 3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built 
I've moved away from building my own SAAS. Instead I'm working with two friends on <a href="http://butlr.me">butlr</a>, a project that
won the hackTrin hackathon. This one is looking good. I'm also continuing freelance web development and just got
a new contract.
 
### 4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books
I finished Short History of Nearly Everything and I'm working on Devil in the White City along with the Immortal 
Life of Henrietta Lacks. I need to pick up the pace but free time is limited. 

### 5. Start making music again
This was one I added after the blog post. I want to start playing guitar again and also learn how to make beats.
This has been going fine but, once again, it's not the first thing I want to do when I have free time.

As far as no 0 days go, I always accomplish something but I still feel like I'm wasting time that could be put towards
accomplishing these goals. So far, this year has been going great.
