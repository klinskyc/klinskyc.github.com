I think almost anyone on the internet has seen this message

 "Log In With Facebook (Twitter, G+) To View"

And I do not think I'm alone in that I leave the page as soon as I see one of them. 
Normally these messages all come in the same form but today I saw something clever.

Instead of just presenting it in the normal we-just-want-your-information way, this site is able
to offer a (shaky) justification while still forcing user signups. The whole idea behind it is a farce
(the opacity is so low that you can see the image anyways) but it stil is an interesting way to
increase user signups.
