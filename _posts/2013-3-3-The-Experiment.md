### The Problem
In recent years I've been reading more and more news online and less and less books. Instead of sitting down 
with a novel or a history book I've been spending that time on Reddit and Hacker News. It's not just me, all
over the world people are reading less. Despite the high quality content on a site like Hacker News,
I get a lot less out of an hour online then I do from an hour of reading. I've been reading more news online because
simply, it's easier to find and consume. So I set out to fix this problem.

### The (Possible) Solution
I started with a Google Doc spreadsheet, a bunch of  HN and Reddit threads of recommended books, and a random number generator. 
My process was quite simple, any book that sounded interesting was put in the spreadsheet. After I was done trawling 
through all the different threads I had a list of about 20 books that I wanted to read, each of them correlating 
with a cell number in the spreadsheet. Using a random number generator I picked out 3 numbers and their corresponding
books. I then, for the first time in years, actually read all of them in a short time frame. After completing each
one I would enter the pages and a short paragraph of my thoughts on the book into the spreadsheet. The enjoyment
of inputting the finished books into the spreadsheet compelled me to read more and more and so far I've read more in the
past two months than I had read in the past year. Is this method revolutionary? Almost surely not, but it helped me.

I'm interested if this same method works for anyone else. Make sure to send me a message on twitter if you try it.
