I recently happened to see this Time Magazine cover.
<img src="http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/2002/1101020415_400.jpg" alt="Time Magazine Cover"/>

The first thing that caught my eye wasn't any of the content but some words in the bottom right corner.

I couldn't believe that a magazine as large as Time would ever put their AOL Keyword on the front page. 
From Jan 31, 2000 to August 14, 2006 Time had it on every issue. This just goes to show how much visibility AOL had
and then lost on the earlier internet. 

Can You Imagine Time having a facebook or twitter link there?
