This is a little different then my normal stuff but I enjoy fantasy football (and football in general) and I
think it's worth posting, if just for my own sake.

This year I joined <a href="http://reddit.com/r/narffl"> NARFFL </a> reddit's fantasy football league, I then promptly
missed the draft. 

When I remember the next day and logged in, the autodraft had picked me this (This is my current line-up,
substitue Tampa Bay with Knile Davis and Julian Edelman with Ronnie Hillman). This league awards 1 point per 
reception.

For an auto-draft this wasn't the worst thing ever

Pros

* An amazing QB in Peyton Manning
* 1 decent rb in Ray Rice 
* Good WR and TE depth (too many TEs)

Cons

* Monte Ball isn't an RB2 or an RB anything, this is a serious problem
* I have way too many TEs and not enough RBs
* I have one ok running back (notice a pattern)

### Before the Game

Trying to be smart I dropped the RB Knile Davis and picked up the Tampa Bay defense because they were playing the Jets. ( the
Jets are my favorite team but it was worth taking the opportunityt
### The First Game 
![Week 1 Matchup](/images/Week1_Matchup.png) 

This week went pretty well, Peyton Manning had a record setting game and Ray Rice and my WRs, TE and Kicked
 had solid performances. My favorite part was that Tampa Bay managed to lose to the Jets and they still put up
 more points than the Bronco's D. 
 
 The only bad thing (and it's a large bad thing) is that Monte Ball put up 2.4 points as it became evident 
 that Denver really is making the game a running back by committee. 

### For Next Week
 
 I need to fix my RB situation, I can probably pawn off Brandon Myers, the NYG Tight End.
