I can't believe its already May, this is a 4 month update.
Overall, things have been going really well. Here's a breakdown

### 1. Get Into a Great College
 * ##### Get Straight A's (A Range) 
 Third Trimester is almost over. My grades right now fulfill this goal but I need to finish out the year strong. 
 I'm taking AP Computer Science on Tueday. Should go really well, but I need to watch out for gotchas. Additionally, finals are coming up during late May. I only have two, but they're two important ones.  
  * ##### Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)
I'm officially done with the SAT 1. The March test went well and I've reached my composite score goal. I'm taking Math 2 (SAT 2) in June. It's a pretty tough test but the curve partly makes up for it. 

### 2. Get Really Fit
 * ##### Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record
 This goal is now have a great record next season. In order to accomplish this, I'm lifting, running, and I'm going to go to wrestling camp. 
 * ##### Be Able to do 15 Pullups
 No real direct progress, I'm not even sure how many I can do. 
 * ##### Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k
I had a few weeks of consistent running and I was seeing progress. As things got more busy, running was one of the first activites to be cut. I'll pick it back up in a few weeks.
 * ##### Increase lifting numbers
I've been really consistent and I'm seeing great results. I bench pressed my bodyweight last week, accomplishing a goal I've had for years. Overall, everythings going up (although bench is having some issues, as expected). The weights getting high enough that I'm starting to not squat and deadlift every single day. 
Current numbers (all in lbs) on big 3 are <br>
BP - 175 (x1)<br>
DL - 260(x5)<br>
Squat - 240(3x5)<br> 

### 3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built 
<a href="http://gevva.com">Gevva</a> (new name for butlr) has been going great. We presented at NY Tech Day and got an amazing response. I'm going to continue to build Gevva with my co-founders and a few interns. 
 
### 4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books
I should be doing more here. I read two books in one day during spring break but that's been it for reading (aside from english class.) I need to choose a fun book to go get myself in the groove again. 

### 5. Start making music again
I haven't really followed through with this. I may pick this up again during the summer.

### 6. Play a lot of Chess
I really want to play chess at passable level. I'm ok (for someone who doesen't play) but I'd like to learn a few openings and get good at analyzing different situations. I'm playing on chess.com  and losing a lot. I think 1200 Elo is a good target. 

I've been busy and productive these past two months, definitely no zero days. However, I can always increase my productivity and organization.
