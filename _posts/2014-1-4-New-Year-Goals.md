It just became 2014 and I figured it would be a good time as any to lay out my goals for this year. 
Since I feel more accountable if I fail my goals publicly, I decided to post them here. Some of the main goals 
have sub-goals that I need to meet if I want to fulfill the main goal.

### 1. Get Into a Great College
 * ##### Get Straight A's (A Range) 
 This is just one of the things that I need to get done if I want to have a competitive application. I was only 
 one grade off last trimester so this is definitely in the realm of possibility.  
 * ##### Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)
 As much as I hate taking them, I need to have great standardized test scores. I'm not too off on practice
 tests so this is also within my reach.
 
### 2. Get Really Fit
 * ##### Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record
 I'm 8-8 right now and we have a mix of both easy and difficult matches to end out the season. If I perform well
 at tournaments I should be able to accomplish this.
 * ##### Be Able to do 15 Pullups
 I'm not starting from 0 with this but I need to get my numbers up from 3-4 to 15. I think this will best be
 accomplished by doing <a href="http://manlypat.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/armstrong-pull-up-program/">this</a>. 
 * ##### Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k
 I really hate running, I find it incredibly boring and I can't ever stick to a running program (unlike a lifting program).
 However, I would like to be good at running and this is accomplished by running. On a good day, I can run a 5k but
 that's about it. I plan on using C25K and B210K.
 * ##### Increase lifting numbers
 Unlike running, I enjoy lifting and do it (when it's not wrestling season) 3 or 4 times a week. I would love to
 increase all my lift numbers by a significant amount. Namely, I'd like to hit a 1xBW Bench, a 1.5XBW Squat, and a 
 1.75BW DLift. I may run into a problem of this being mutually exclusive with running. 

### 3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built 
So far I've built two SAAS's (mostly to really learn rails / you can see them on my projects page). Unfortunately,
I've been unable to convert free customers to paying customers. I think the real reason for this is that my projects
don't solve painful enough problems. I'm going to try and create a product that really uses lean startup principles.
 1. Find a problem via interviewing different professions.
 2. Build and constantly iterate a product that solves the aforementioned problem 
 
### 4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books
As previously written about on this blog, I have a reading list that I'm constantly updating. I want (start and) Finish
the remaining books left on the list. Last year, I read 17 books off my list, this year I hope to reach 20. 

 In the coming year, I really only have 1 thing that I'm going to stick to religiously, the idea of no zero-days. 
 I have a problem where I'll be incredibly productive for a few days and then do nothing for another few days. My 
 overall goal is to always spend sometime every day getting closer to accomplishing these goals.
