After spending the last few months working on and off on a large project (more on that over the summer), I was 
feeling burnt out from constantly getting stuck on large-scale bugs. In response to this, I decided to make
something incredibly simple in an area that I had never worked in before. After spending a few minutes googling
how to make a rss feed out of a twitter profile I decided to simplify an already simple process and make a chrome
extension, something I had never done before. After half an hour, The result was <a href="https://chr

chrome extension that made a rss feed out of any twitter-page. I paid the five dollar publishing fee and went
to bed, happy that I had finally finished something, albeit tiny. After one week, I checked the stats and saw 
something that astounded me, the weekly users were up to 13. I was surprised, why would anyone want to install an
extension that had so little use? Honestly, I still have no idea. All I know is that I got more users for 30 minutes
of work than I did over two months and I'm happy about it. 

On another note the Chrome Web Store is a Mecca for lean-startupers
(is that a word?). It allows for fast iterations and feedback in an app-store environment that already has a 
userbase, free advertising and users without the restrictions of the Apple or Google Play stores. 

You can see the extension <a href="https://chr
