  </h1>

  <section class="byline">
    March 14, 2014
  </section>

  <p>It&rsquo;s two months to the day that I posted my initial goals.
Since then, I&rsquo;ve updated some of my goals, failed a few and, I&rsquo;m on track to accomplish more.</p>

<h3>1. Get Into a Great College</h3>

<ul>
<li><h5>Get Straight A&rsquo;s (A Range)</h5>

<p>Second trimester grades are in. My grades increased as a whole, but I still failed to get everything into the A range
because one grade dipped.</p></li>
<li><h5>Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)</h5>

<p>Got my scores back from the first time and I did well, but math and writing were lower than normal so I&rsquo;m going to
be retaking them on March 8th. This is the last time.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>2. Get Really Fit</h3>

<ul>
<li><h5>Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record</h5>

<p>Failed this one. I ended up going 13-16. I did place at both Ivies and States. I should have finished 3rd at Ivies, but I blew
a match I had in the bag.</p></li>
<li><h5>Be Able to do 15 Pullups</h5>

<p>No real progress, I need to do this on offdays.</p></li>
<li><h5>Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing some stationary cycling but no jogging. I&rsquo;ve been focusing more on lifting.</p></li>
<li><h5>Increase lifting numbers</h5>

<p>Lift numbers are getting back to what they were pre-wrestling season. I&rsquo;m eating a lot and breaking plateaus.
My form on deadlift suffers when I get above 200 so I need deload and focus on form.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve moved away from building my own SAAS. Instead I&rsquo;m working with two friends on <a href="http://butlr.me">butlr</a>, a project that
won the hackTrin hackathon. This one is looking good. I&rsquo;m also continuing freelance web development and just got
a new contract.</p>

<h3>4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books</h3>

<p>I finished Short History of Nearly Everything and I&rsquo;m working on Devil in the White City along with the Immortal
Life of Henrietta Lacks. I need to pick up the pace but free time is limited.</p>

<h3>5. Start making music again</h3>

<p>This was one I added after the blog post. I want to start playing guitar again and also learn how to make beats.
This has been going fine but, once again, it&rsquo;s not the first thing I want to do when I have free time.</p>

<p>As far as no 0 days go, I always accomplish something, but I still feel like I&rsquo;m wasting time that could be put towards
accomplishing these goals. So far, this year has been going great.</p>
