  <p>In this Inaugural Post I&rsquo;ll take briefly about what I use on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>Gadgets</h3>

<h3>Mid 2012 13 Inch MacBook Pro (Non Retina)</h3>

<p><img src="http://images.pcworld.com/reviews/graphics/products/uploaded/apple_13inch_macbook_pro29ghz_core_i5_mid_2012_1220659_g1.jpg" height="400" width="400">
This is my true workhorse and everything I do ends up on this at some point.
 Before I bought it I was torn between this model and the 13 Inch Macbook Air and
 while I am sure I would say the exact opposite if I had gone with the Air I feel
 like I made the right decision. I think it represents a nice compromise between portability, computing power,
 and price. I carry it around every day and I have no complaints about it&rsquo;s weight. Albeit from a few scuffs and a little dirt it has held up well to pretty rough daily treatment. If only chargers faired as well.
  I do miss having a 24 inch screen but less than I thought I would due to a makeshift solution (more on that in a moment).</p>

<h3>IPhone 3GS</h3>

<p><img src="http://images.pcworld.com/reviews/graphics/products/uploaded/116744_g2.jpg" height="300" width="300">
Since I got this in 2009 I&rsquo;ve slowly watched it go from top of the line to barely supported
 while giving me no problems all the while. My apps still run and my music still plays so I have still have
 not seen any compelling reason to upgrade. I&rsquo;m still running 5.0.1 as my 3GS doesn&rsquo;t get many of the new features of 6.0 and Siri.
 I think I would have upgraded already if not for wonderful jailbreak apps like SBSettings that I don&rsquo;t feel like going through the process of reinstalling again.</p>

<h3>Early 2009 24 Inch iMac</h3>

<p> <img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/03/newimac.jpg" height="400" width="400">
My main computer for 3 years, it now sits on my desk serving niche purposes. It&rsquo;s main use now is as a hacked together second monitor for my MBP. I have yet to find a working, practical
solution to use it as a true second monitor so I&rsquo;ve just been using teleport(like synergy) and
Soundflow to almost make it one. I normally use it to show Movies, Chat, or pdfs, documents and
websites that I need to constantly reference. Since its on 10.6 it&rsquo;s used for any Powerpc
app or non-updated intel app. I also use it to run .bat files. For these things it works pretty well.</p>

<h3>iPad 2 3G</h3>

<p><img src="http://cdn1.sbnation.com/products/large/126/1300358445apple_ipad2_black_01.jpg?1312559901"  height="400" width="400">
I bought this in 2011 to use as my portable community and it served its job ok before being replaced by my MBP.
For anything non-intensive like web-browsing, email, reddit, or reading, the iPad performs beautifully.
The cracks begin to show when you try to do anything more.
Even with a bluetooth keyboard, writing anything longer than an email is slow and unfun.
It gets even worse when I try to do actual work on it. Despite trying almost every native solution
(I never tried ssh) the iPad never came close to being as good as a real computer for coding, image editing,
or anything else. If I can&rsquo;t install ruby or git on a computer then I can&rsquo;t use it as real computer.
The iPad is currently being used as a dedicated ebook reader and other light browsing and for this it performs admirably.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<h3>BBEdit</h3>

<p><img src="http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/story/60/19/010594/bbedit-10-screenshot-ogrady.png" height="400" width="400">
One of the oldest text editors for mac, I haven&rsquo;t been using this for that long. I switched to this from TextMate a few years ago because of it&rsquo;s overflowing features.
For something that was supposed to be barebones it really has everything. The two main reasons I switched I because I liked the layout and it&rsquo;s ftp support more than TextMate.
I&rsquo;ve recently been thinking about trying out Sublime Text 2 but I don&rsquo;t feel like leaving this old friend.</p>

<h3>Terminal</h3>

<p><img src="http://peppoj.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/512-Terminal.png" height="300" width="300"></p>

<p>Not much to say here, just the vanilla Mac OSX Terminal.No complaints, always works as expected.</p>

<h3>Google Chrome</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/04/chrome-logo-2011-04-27.jpg"  height="300" width="300">
Once again pretty standard stuff. I&rsquo;ve found this to be (at least for me) the fastest full-featured browser.
 I&rsquo;ve found the sync feature to be invaluable along with plugins like Adblock and LastPass.</p>

<h3>Sparrow</h3>

<p><img src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17tf13akoui94png/original.png"  height="400" width="400">
Although it&rsquo;s been bought by google and discontinued I still use this as my desktop email client.
 It does everything I could ask for and it does it well. If I had to choose one feature it would be its top-notch
 multi-email account integration.</p>

<h3>Dropbox</h3>

<p><img src="https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/480262550/box.png" height="300" width="300">
While this is another standard, I can&rsquo;t even count the number of times it&rsquo;s backups have saved me from forgetting
to print or transfer something. It also makes a wonderful way to share files.
 My only modification is that I&rsquo;ve set up symlinks to allow me to back up other directories not in the dropbox folder.</p>

<h3>Google Docs</h3>

<p><img src="http://edudemic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GoogleDocs.jpg" height="300" width="300">
I have the entire Microsoft Office Suite on my computer but I find myself almost never using it due to this
wonderful Office replacement. It fulfills all my needs while doing it in its own lightweight, cloud backuped way.</p>
