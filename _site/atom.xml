   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe its already May, this is a 4 month update.
Overall, things have been going really well. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Get Into a Great College&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Get Straight A&amp;rsquo;s (A Range)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third Trimester is almost over. My grades right now fulfill this goal but I need to finish out the year strong.
I&amp;rsquo;m taking AP Computer Science on Tueday. Should go really well, but I need to watch out for gotchas. Additionally, finals are coming up during late May. I only have two, but they&amp;rsquo;re two{

  //&amp;ldquo;allow_config_upload&amp;rdquo;: false,
}
important ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m officially done with the SAT 1. The March test went well and I&amp;rsquo;ve reached my composite score goal. I&amp;rsquo;m taking Math 2 (SAT 2) in June. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty tough test but the curve partly makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;2. Get Really Fit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goal is now have a great record next season. In order to accomplish this, I&amp;rsquo;m lifting, running, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to go to wrestling camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Be Able to do 15 Pullups&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No real direct progress, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure how many I can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few weeks of consistent running and I was seeing progress. As things got more busy, running was one of the first activites to be cut. I&amp;rsquo;ll pick it back up in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Increase lifting numbers&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really consistent and I&amp;rsquo;m seeing great results. I bench pressed my bodyweight last week, accomplishing a goal I&amp;rsquo;ve had for years. Overall, everythings going up (although bench is having some issues, as expected). The weights getting high enough that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to not squat and deadlift every single day.
Current numbers (all in lbs) on big 3 are &lt;br&gt;
BP &amp;ndash; 175 (x1)&lt;br&gt;
DL &amp;ndash; 260(x5)&lt;br&gt;
Squat &amp;ndash; 240(3x5)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gevva.com&quot;&gt;Gevva&lt;/a&gt; (new name for butlr) has been going great. We presented at NY Tech Day and got an amazing response. I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue to build Gevva with my co-founders and a few interns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be doing more here. I read two books in one day during spring break but that&amp;rsquo;s been it for reading (aside from english class.) I need to choose a fun book to go get myself in the groove again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Start making music again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t really followed through with this. I may pick this up again during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Play a lot of Chess&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want to play chess at passable level. I&amp;rsquo;m ok (for someone who doesen&amp;rsquo;t play) but I&amp;rsquo;d like to learn a few openings and get good at analyzing different situations. I&amp;rsquo;m playing on chess.com  and losing a lot. I think 1200 Elo is a good target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy and productive these past two months, definitely no zero days. However, I can always increase my productivity and organization.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Crafting The Perfect Workout Playlist</title>
   <link href="http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/Crafting-The-Perfect-Workout-Playlist"/>
   <updated>2014-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/Crafting-The-Perfect-Workout-Playlist</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts of lifting is that I get to listen to music while I do it. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of
opportunites to listen to music for 90 minutes, uniterrupted, with a completely clear head. Additionaly, listening to the
right music is scientifically proven to increase athletic performance. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-workout-music&quot;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; goes into greater detail and gives a rough idea of what music works best. The article essentially says that music needs to have the right tempo and evoke certain memories, emotions, and assosciations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following guide uses both scientific recommendations and my personal experiences to give guidelines on how to craft the perfect workout playlist. My specific song recommendations are mostly rap, but theres no reason that this can&amp;rsquo;t be applied to any genre of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part 1: The Warmup&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warmup generally takes me from when I arrive at the gym to when I start my working sets. If I have a short commute, less than 10 minutes, I&amp;rsquo;ll also incorporate that time into the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. The First Song&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first song is important to set the tone of the rest of the workout. It&amp;rsquo;s generally upbeat and slower then the majority of the playlist. It&amp;rsquo;s a song that puts a smile on your face and gets you ready for the rest of your workout. I normally listen to this while warming up on an eliptical or biking to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently use Chain Smoker by Chance the Rapper. It fits all these critera and is a fantastic song. Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Good Ass Intro (also by Chance). Additionally, The new albulm Retrohash by Asher Roth is filled with songs that fit these criterias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90243763&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;2. The Rest of the Warmup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the warmup section should be used to slowly ramp up to working sets. Each song should still be upbeat, but the intensity of each song should gradually increase. These songs generally encompass setting up equipment, saying hellos, and doing the warmup reps of your first major lift. This part should end by the time you start your working sets. Timewise, this part lasts around ten minutes for me, but this varies person to person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three songs I currently use are (in order)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/118090242&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;




&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0ErMK31Mr9j6tPA1F58rT9&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;




&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0SyXvJ6uRArVWHXUyi3FKO&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They go from ridiculous to more serious, putting my mind in the right place for the rest of my workout and setting up the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part 2: The Meat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Meat&amp;rdquo; is the majority of the workout. It&amp;rsquo;s the music I listen to when I do the heaviest, most difficult portions of my workout. I need this music to motivate me, keep me focused, and help me get that last rep out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. The Getting Serious Song&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most important song in the playlist. It&amp;rsquo;s responsible for getting my mental state ready to lift hundreds of pounds. This song should make you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re about to start a battle. Generally, the &amp;ldquo;getting serious&amp;rdquo; song should display raw emotion, full of anger and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &amp;ldquo;getting serious&amp;rdquo; song is currently XXX by Danny Brown. It fits the bill perfectly and I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself changing it anytime soon. It&amp;rsquo;s angry, emotional, and gets you pumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:7bK9xOZYM05LOh4bvk2Sl7&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;2. The &amp;ldquo;Lets Do This&amp;rdquo; Song&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song directly follows the &amp;ldquo;getting serious&amp;rdquo; song and normally plays around the end of your first real set. It&amp;rsquo;s the final transistion from warmup to the real workout. In one word, it should sound &amp;ldquo;epic&amp;rdquo;. I currently use Crawl by Childish Gambino&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Year Goals 2 Month Update</title>
   <link href="http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/New-Year-Goals-2-Month-Update"/>
   <updated>2014-03-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/New-Year-Goals-2-Month-Update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s two months to the day that I posted my initial goals.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated some of my goals, failed a few and, I&amp;rsquo;m on track to accomplish more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Get Into a Great College&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Get Straight A&amp;rsquo;s (A Range)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second trimester grades are in. My grades increased as a whole, but I still failed to get everything into the A range
because one grade dipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got my scores back from the first time and I did well, but math and writing were lower than normal so I&amp;rsquo;m going to
be retaking them on March 8th. This is the last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;2. Get Really Fit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failed this one. I ended up going 13-16. I did place at both Ivies and States. I should have finished 3rd at Ivies, but I blew
a match I had in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Be Able to do 15 Pullups&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No real progress, I need to do this on offdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some stationary cycling but no jogging. I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing more on lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Increase lifting numbers&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lift numbers are getting back to what they were pre-wrestling season. I&amp;rsquo;m eating a lot and breaking plateaus.
My form on deadlift suffers when I get above 200 so I need deload and focus on form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve moved away from building my own SAAS. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m working with two friends on &lt;a href=&quot;http://butlr.me&quot;&gt;butlr&lt;/a&gt;, a project that
won the hackTrin hackathon. This one is looking good. I&amp;rsquo;m also continuing freelance web development and just got
a new contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished Short History of Nearly Everything and I&amp;rsquo;m working on Devil in the White City along with the Immortal
Life of Henrietta Lacks. I need to pick up the pace but free time is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Start making music again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one I added after the blog post. I want to start playing guitar again and also learn how to make beats.
This has been going fine but, once again, it&amp;rsquo;s not the first thing I want to do when I have free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as no 0 days go, I always accomplish something, but I still feel like I&amp;rsquo;m wasting time that could be put towards
accomplishing these goals. So far, this year has been going great.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Year Goals</title>
   <link href="http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/New-Year-Goals"/>
   <updated>2014-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/New-Year-Goals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It just became 2014 and I figured it would be a good time as any to lay out my goals for this year.
Since I feel more accountable if I fail my goals publicly, I decided to post them here. Some of the main goals
have sub-goals that I need to meet if I want to fulfill the main goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Get Into a Great College&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Get Straight A&amp;rsquo;s (A Range)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one of the things that I need to get done if I want to have a competitive application. I was only
one grade off last trimester so this is definitely in the realm of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Get Outstanding SAT Scores (and only have to take them once)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I hate taking them, I need to have great standardized test scores. I&amp;rsquo;m not too off on practice
tests so this is also within my reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;2. Get Really Fit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Finish out the Wrestling season with a positive record&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 8-8 right now and we have a mix of both easy and difficult matches to end out the season. If I perform well
at tournaments I should be able to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Be Able to do 15 Pullups&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not starting from 0 with this but I need to get my numbers up from 3-4 to 15. I think this will best be
accomplished by doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://manlypat.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/armstrong-pull-up-program/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Be able to run a 10K/ Run a sub 24 minute 5k&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hate running, I find it incredibly boring and I can&amp;rsquo;t ever stick to a running program (unlike a lifting program).
However, I would like to be good at running and this is accomplished by running. On a good day, I can run a 5k but
that&amp;rsquo;s about it. I plan on using C25K and B210K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Increase lifting numbers&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike running, I enjoy lifting and do it (when it&amp;rsquo;s not wrestling season) 3 or 4 times a week. I would love to
increase all my lift numbers by a significant amount. Namely, I&amp;rsquo;d like to hit a 1xBW Bench, a 1.5XBW Squat, and a
1.75BW DLift. I may run into a problem of this being mutually exclusive with running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;3. Have someone pay to use a SAAS I built&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve built two SAAS&amp;rsquo;s (mostly to really learn rails / you can see them on my projects page). Unfortunately,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to convert free customers to paying customers. I think the real reason for this is that my projects
don&amp;rsquo;t solve painful enough problems. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and create a product that really uses lean startup principles.
 1. Find a problem via interviewing different professions.
 2. Build and constantly iterate a product that solves the aforementioned problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Finish my reading list / Read 20 Books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously written about on this blog, I have a reading list that I&amp;rsquo;m constantly updating. I want (start and) Finish
the remaining books left on the list. Last year, I read 17 books off my list, this year I hope to reach 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In the coming year, I really only have 1 thing that I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick to religiously, the idea of no zero-days.
 I have a problem where I&amp;rsquo;ll be incredibly productive for a few days and then do nothing for another few days. My
 overall goal is to always spend sometime every day getting closer to accomplishing these goals.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fantasy Football Week 1</title>
   <link href="http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/Fantasy-Football-Week-1"/>
   <updated>2013-09-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/Fantasy-Football-Week-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a little different then my normal stuff but I enjoy fantasy football (and football in general) and I
think it&amp;rsquo;s worth posting, if just for my own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I joined &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com/r/narffl&quot;&gt; NARFFL &lt;/a&gt; reddit&amp;rsquo;s fantasy football league, I then promptly
missed the draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I remember the next day and logged in, the autodraft had picked me this (This is my current line-up,
substitue Tampa Bay with Knile Davis and Julian Edelman with Ronnie Hillman). This league awards 1 point per
reception.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fflineup-week2.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Fantasy Football Team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an auto-draft this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the worst thing ever&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An amazing QB in Peyton Manning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 decent rb in Ray Rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good WR and TE depth (too many TEs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monte Ball isn&amp;rsquo;t an RB2 or an RB anything, this is a serious problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have way too many TEs and not enough RBs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have one ok running back (notice a pattern)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Before the Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to be smart I dropped the RB Knile Davis and picked up the Tampa Bay defense because they were playing the Jets. ( the
Jets are my favorite team but it was worth taking the opportunityt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The First Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Week1_Matchup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Week 1 Matchup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week went pretty well, Peyton Manning had a record setting game and Ray Rice and my WRs, TE and Kicked
 had solid performances. My favorite part was that Tampa Bay managed to lose to the Jets and they still put up
 more points than the Bronco&amp;rsquo;s D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The only bad thing (and it&amp;rsquo;s a large bad thing) is that Monte Ball put up 2.4 points as it became evident
 that Denver really is making the game a running back by committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;For Next Week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I need to fix my RB situation, I can probably pawn off Brandon Myers, the NYG Tight End.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Have 13 Users And I Am Ecstatic</title>

   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/I-Have-13-Users-And-I-Am-Ecstatic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After spending the last few months working on and off on a large project (more on that over the summer), I was
feeling burnt out from constantly getting stuck on large-scale bugs. In response to this, I decided to make
something incredibly simple in an area that I had never worked in before. After spending a few minutes googling
how to make a rss feed out of a twitter profile I decided to simplify an already simple process and make a chrome
extension, something I had never done before. After half an hour, The result was &lt;a href=&quot;https://chr
ome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter2rss/obnmifkmfdnijcnmhacachchiikikchb&quot; &gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, a sub20 lines of code
chrome extension that made a rss feed out of any twitter-page. I paid the five dollar publishing fee and went
to bed, happy that I had finally finished something, albeit tiny. After one week, I checked the stats and saw
something that astounded me, the weekly users were up to 13. I was surprised, why would anyone want to install an
extension that had so little use? Honestly, I still have no idea. All I know is that I got more users for 30 minutes
of work than I did over two months and I&amp;rsquo;m happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note the Chrome Web Store is a Mecca for lean-startupers
(is that a word?). It allows for fast iterations and feedback in an app-store environment that already has a
userbase, free advertising and users without the restrictions of the Apple or Google Play stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the extension &lt;a href=&quot;https://chr
ome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter2rss/obnmifkmfdnijcnmhacachchiikikchb&quot; &gt; here &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/An-Interesting-Attempt-At-Getting-User-Signups</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think almost anyone on the internet has seen this message&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo;Log In With Facebook (Twitter, G+) To View&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do not think I&amp;rsquo;m alone in that I leave the page as soon as I see one of them.
Normally these messages all come in the same form but today I saw something clever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Facebook_Signup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Are You Over 13?&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of just presenting it in the normal we-just-want-your-information way, this site is able
to offer a (shaky) justification while still forcing user signups. The whole idea behind it is a farce
(the opacity is so low that you can see the image anyways) but it stil is an interesting way to
increase user signups.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/How-The-Mighty-Have-Fallen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently happened to see this Time Magazine cover.
&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/2002/1101020415_400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Time Magazine Cover&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that caught my eye wasn&amp;rsquo;t any of the content but some words in the bottom right corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/AOLTime.png&quot; alt=&quot;AOL Keyword: Time&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe that a magazine as large as Time would ever put their AOL Keyword on the front page.
From Jan 31, 2000 to August 14, 2006 Time had it on every issue. This just goes to show how much power and visibility AOL had
and then lost on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can You Imagine Time having a Facebook or Twitter link there?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Experiment</title>
   <link href="http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/The-Experiment"/>
   <updated>2013-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/The-Experiment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading more and more news online and fewer and fewer books. Instead of sitting down
with a novel or a history book I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending that time on Reddit and Hacker News. It&amp;rsquo;s not just me, all
over the world people are reading less. Despite the high quality content on a site like Hacker News,
I get a lot less out of an hour online then I do from an hour of reading. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading more news online because
simply, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to find and consume. So I set out to fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The (Possible) Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a Google Doc spreadsheet, a bunch of  HN and Reddit threads of recommended books, and a random number generator.
My process was quite simple, any book that sounded interesting was put in the spreadsheet. After I was done trawling
through all the different threads I had a list of about 20 books that I wanted to read, each of them correlating
with a cell number in the spreadsheet. Using a random number generator I picked out 3 numbers and their corresponding
books. I then, for the first time in years, actually read all of them in a short time frame. After completing each
one I would enter the pages and a short paragraph of my thoughts on the book into the spreadsheet. The enjoyment
of entering the finished books into the spreadsheet compelled me to read more and more and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve read more in the
past two months than I had read in the past year. Is this method revolutionary? Almost surely not, but it helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the spreadsheet &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As9wx2iv9PqudEN5S3FuT0NJeHNhSldKSmoyV3dCeWc&amp;usp=sharing&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know whether this method works for anyone else. Make sure to send me a message on twitter if you try it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apple's Future</title>
   <link href="http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/Apple%27s-Future"/>
   <updated>2013-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/Apple's-Future</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;A Non-Expert&amp;rsquo;s Opinion on Apple&amp;rsquo;s Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dust of Job’s death is settled and the scoreboard speaks for itself. During Steve Job’s two-part twenty-four year tenure with Apple the world was changed.  Job’s innovations are innumerable, from the Apple I to the IPad, Jobs has created computer revolutions and has moved forward the world in which we live in. Apple without Jobs shows a stark contrast, without Jobs Apple has a history of creating forgotten misguided products like the Macintosh Performa or the Apple Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Job’s death Apple has been running on the fumes of his genius, any attempts to go off his path have led to overhyped misstep after overhyped misstep. Siri, a technology that was supposed to change the world and one of the first things to come out of Apple post Jobs, has been a novelty at best and broken at worst. It is only one in a long growing line of failing products. Apple Maps, a recently made competitor to Google Maps, has been a flop. In a rare apology from a company that until recently has had nothing to be sorry about, CEO Tim Cook wrote “We fell short on Apple Maps.”  This is putting it lightly; Apple Maps has been repeatedly called a “complete failure” and led to the ousting of mobile software head Scott Forstall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s competitors are catching up to and surpassing Apple’s growth. With the new additions of the Kindle Fire, Windows Surface, and the Google Nexus 7 along with many other smartphones and tablets, the smartphone and tablet market is getting crowded and Apple is beginning to be squeezed out by low priced competitors. In 2012, Samsung, one of Apple’s major competitors, gained three times as much market share as Apple in the smartphone market. In the tablet market, Apple’s market share has dropped from 90% two years ago to only 44% today. The new growth opportunities created by the fall of former smartphone giants Research in Motion and Nokia is not being seized by Apple but by its competitors, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Another worrying trend for Apple is its seeming reliance on new hardware innovations to acquire customers. For a company that made it’s name with new innovations in both  software and hardware, its recent software innovations have been few and far between. Even when they do innovate, like with the aforementioned Siri and Maps, the innovations are almost totally malfunctioning failures. Jobs, in his lifetime, refused to accept anything less than perfection. After the launch of MobileMe, one of the few blemishes in Jobs’ tenure at Apple, Jobs gathered the MobileMe team into a room and said “You&amp;rsquo;ve tarnished Apple&amp;rsquo;s reputation, you should hate each other for having let each other down.”  If this was what Jobs did after such a small blemish, imagine how he would have reacted to the full-scale meltdown that was Apple Maps. Jobs would have, at least in one former Apple employees opinion, “lost his mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dearth of new must-have technology is allowing competitors like Google and Amazon to catch back up. Since September Apple’s stock price has been down 35%. Apple’s most recent quarter report was four billion dollars short of estimated revenue and Apple lost its spot as most valuable company.   Apple needs to innovate or die and currently they are dying. Apple is slowly starting to fade into obscurity.  As Edmund Burke put it “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Apple can only sink from here, don’t go down with the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What I Use</title>
   <link href="http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/What-I-Use"/>
   <updated>2013-01-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://klinskyc.github.io/posts/What-I-Use</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this Inaugural Post I&amp;rsquo;ll take briefly about what I use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Gadgets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mid 2012 13 Inch MacBook Pro (Non Retina)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pcworld.com/reviews/graphics/products/uploaded/apple_13inch_macbook_pro29ghz_core_i5_mid_2012_1220659_g1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
This is my true workhorse and everything I do ends up on this at some point.
 Before I bought it I was torn between this model and the 13 Inch Macbook Air and
 while I am sure I would say the exact opposite if I had gone with the Air I feel
 like I made the right decision. I think it represents a nice compromise between portability, computing power,
 and price. I carry it around every day and I have no complaints about it&amp;rsquo;s weight. Albeit from a few scuffs and a little dirt it has held up well to pretty rough daily treatment. If only chargers faired as well.
  I do miss having a 24 inch screen but less than I thought I would due to a makeshift solution (more on that in a moment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IPhone 3GS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pcworld.com/reviews/graphics/products/uploaded/116744_g2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
Since I got this in 2009 I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly watched it go from top of the line to barely supported
 while giving me no problems all the while. My apps still run and my music still plays so I have still have
 not seen any compelling reason to upgrade. I&amp;rsquo;m still running 5.0.1 as my 3GS doesn&amp;rsquo;t get many of the new features of 6.0 and Siri.
 I think I would have upgraded already if not for wonderful jailbreak apps like SBSettings that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like going through the process of reinstalling again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Early 2009 24 Inch iMac&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/03/newimac.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
My main computer for 3 years, it now sits on my desk serving niche purposes. It&amp;rsquo;s main use now is as a hacked together second monitor for my MBP. I have yet to find a working, practical
solution to use it as a true second monitor so I&amp;rsquo;ve just been using teleport(like synergy) and
Soundflow to almost make it one. I normally use it to show Movies, Chat, or pdfs, documents and
websites that I need to constantly reference. Since its on 10.6 it&amp;rsquo;s used for any Powerpc
app or non-updated intel app. I also use it to run .bat files. For these things it works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;iPad 2 3G&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn1.sbnation.com/products/large/126/1300358445apple_ipad2_black_01.jpg?1312559901&quot;  height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
I bought this in 2011 to use as my portable community and it served its job ok before being replaced by my MBP.
For anything non-intensive like web-browsing, email, reddit, or reading, the iPad performs beautifully.
The cracks begin to show when you try to do anything more.
Even with a bluetooth keyboard, writing anything longer than an email is slow and unfun.
It gets even worse when I try to do actual work on it. Despite trying almost every native solution
(I never tried ssh) the iPad never came close to being as good as a real computer for coding, image editing,
or anything else. If I can&amp;rsquo;t install ruby or git on a computer then I can&amp;rsquo;t use it as real computer.
The iPad is currently being used as a dedicated ebook reader and other light browsing and for this it performs admirably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;BBEdit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/story/60/19/010594/bbedit-10-screenshot-ogrady.png&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
One of the oldest text editors for mac, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using this for that long. I switched to this from TextMate a few years ago because of it&amp;rsquo;s overflowing features.
For something that was supposed to be barebones it really has everything. The two main reasons I switched I because I liked the layout and it&amp;rsquo;s ftp support more than TextMate.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been thinking about trying out Sublime Text 2 but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like leaving this old friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Terminal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://peppoj.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/512-Terminal.png&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much to say here, just the vanilla Mac OSX Terminal.No complaints, always works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/04/chrome-logo-2011-04-27.jpg&quot;  height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
Once again pretty standard stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this to be (at least for me) the fastest full-featured browser.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve found the sync feature to be invaluable along with plugins like Adblock and LastPass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sparrow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17tf13akoui94png/original.png&quot;  height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
Although it&amp;rsquo;s been bought by google and discontinued I still use this as my desktop email client.
 It does everything I could ask for and it does it well. If I had to choose one feature it would be its top-notch
 multi-email account integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/480262550/box.png&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
While this is another standard, I can&amp;rsquo;t even count the number of times it&amp;rsquo;s backups have saved me from forgetting
to print or transfer something. It also makes a wonderful way to share files.
 My only modification is that I&amp;rsquo;ve set up symlinks to allow me to back up other directories not in the dropbox folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Google Docs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://edudemic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GoogleDocs.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;
I have the entire Microsoft Office Suite on my computer but I find myself almost never using it due to this
wonderful Office replacement. It fulfills all my needs while doing it in its own lightweight, cloud backuped way.&lt;/p&gt;
